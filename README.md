# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Deployment

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the Vite app and deploys the static `dist` output to GitHub Pages on pushes to the `main` branch.

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
- Trigger: `push` to `main` (change branch in the workflow if your default branch is different)

Notes:

- The workflow runs `npm install` and `npm run build` (the `build` script is `vite build`).
- It then uploads the `dist` folder and uses the official Pages actions to deploy.
- Ensure your repository has a `main` branch or update `.github/workflows/pages.yml` to the branch you use.
- GitHub Pages will use the artifact deployed by the Action (no extra token is required).

How to use:

1. Push this repository to GitHub (replace `<your-repo-url>`):

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

2. On push to `main`, the Action will run and deploy the site. You can check the Pages deployment in the repository `Settings > Pages` or the Actions tab.
